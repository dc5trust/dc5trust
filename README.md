### Hello World, my name is Hector 💻

I'm a software Engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Cal State Northridge. Although Computer Science is a broad field, I enjoy web development because of the potential outreach is boundless. Ultimately, my goal is to become a full stack developer and take my problem solving skills to new heights.
