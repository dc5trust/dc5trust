### Hello World, my name is Hector ðŸ’»

I'm a software Engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Cal State Northridge. And web development has always been an area of interest because of the potential outreach being boundless. Ultimately, my goal is to become a full stack developer and take my problem solving skills to new heights.
