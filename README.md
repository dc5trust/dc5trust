### Hello World, my name is Hector 💻

I'm a software Engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Cal State Northridge. And although, Computer Science is a broad field, I enjoy web development because user outreach is limitless. The goal is to become a full stack developer and take my problem solving skills to new heights. I also have a passion for producing and editing video projects.
